    ravus "Ah, the prodigal Advisor returns."

    ravus "You're a fool for taking him on, you know."

    ignis "And you're a bloody idiot for attempting the same."

    ignis "Is Noct here?"

    you "Yes. He's right beside you."

    narrator1 "Ignis tries to reach out to him, but falls back, exhaustion getting the better of him."

    you "Ah! Ignis!"

    ravus "I'm not surprised, with those wounds."

    you "Be strong, Ignis, be strong... Please... It'll be okay now..."

    narrator1 "Some of your words feel hollow, but you really, truly mean them. You stroke the wet hair off his forehead, gently pulling strands away from his inflamed wounds."

    you "You'll be okay. You will."

    narrator1 "Behind you, "

    ravus "Either he doesn't realise he's not on the ship, or he doesn't care."

    you "He doesn't care? Why go to all the trouble if he doesn't care?"

    ravus "He'll just find someone else to play the role he desires."

    narrator1 "You don't quite know what this means, but it gives you a sickly feeling in the pit of your stomach."

    narrator1 "You look back to Ignis, breathing so softly as he rests on the ground, unconscious, vulnerable, unaware."

    narrator1 "How could anyone hurt him?"

    narrator1 "How could anyone use him?"

    narrator1 "The urge to protect him is so strong, you never thought it possible to feel this intensely."

    ravus "Ignis's companions are on their way. You are no longer needed."

    narrator1 "This makes you bristle; you feel like you've been pretty damn instrumental so far, and you don't enjoy the cold manner in which he says this."

    you "I want to stay with him."

    ravus "You have very limited choice. Ardyn is leaving, and I've ordered a full military retreat. Your superiors need to know about that."

    ravus "And ... about Luna."

    narrator1 "He bends down to touch Lunafreya's cheek softly, and you hate noticing how his fingers meet with the stiffness of her flesh. Rigor mortis has already set in."

    ravus "Would that I could stay with you, dear sister."

    narrator1 "Then he rises, and speaks to you once more."

    ravus "I can't be seen here when your superiors arrive. It shall be up to you to inform them of her passing."

    narrator1 "He turns to go."

    you "Hey, Ravus."
