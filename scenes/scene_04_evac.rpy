    # show bg yureil plaza busy

    "You and Ignis both make your way to the back of the plaza."

    # sound effect crowd buzzing

    "You catch sight of a black-haired individual moving through the crowd. Your first thought is that he's moving irregularly, and as a guard, this is a cause for concern."

    "But there's something about him that looks familiar. It's a figure you've seen countless times on news reports before. The Crown Prince of Lucis is here?"

    "Ignis catches your gaze, and holds a finger to his lips softly."

    you "Is he with you?"

    ignis "Indeed he is."

    "You're just a guard, after all. You only get told things that are mission-critical."

    # sound effect engine hum
    "A distant hum interrupts your thoughts. A sort of revving, and it's getting closer."

    "You look up to see Imperial dreadnoughts approaching."

    "Altissia has had so many years of peace under Niflheim's rule that you've almost forgotten the sight of these monstrosities."
