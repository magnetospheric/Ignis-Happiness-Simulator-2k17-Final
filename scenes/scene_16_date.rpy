    scene bg magisterialsquare

    "Night has fallen across Altissia. You're waiting by the Magisterial Square, just as Ignis said."

    "You still can't believe he wants to do this."

    "After a while, you spot him, that tall, svelte figure at the head of the stairs leading up to this place."

    "He's accompanied by the blond boy ... Prompto, was it? At any rate, you're glad to see someone is helping him."

    "His friend pats his shoulder in solidarity, then vanishes back into the crowd."

    narrator1 "You walk over."

    you "Hi, Ignis."

    ignis "A pleasure, [your_name]."







ignis "I know they mean well, and I know they think they're doing what's best for me..."

ignis ""


ignis "I would never have expected a man like Ardyn to keep his word..."

narrator1 "{i}Ardyn.{/i} Even being spoken so plainly, the name sends shivers down your spine."

ignis "But still, it disturbs me. He offered me a {i}choice{/i}. I said no, and still, he..."

you "A choice?"

ignis "Yes - he offered to take me to Niflheim."

ignis "If it hadn't been for my ... for my eyes ... I wouldn't have to feel this same way every time people do something I don't ask them to."

ignis "And again, I know they mean well."


you "Well, right now, we're gonna change that "
