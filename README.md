# Ignis-Happiness-Simulator-Final
A wee dating sim where you get to hug Ignis from FFXV

** Going off the back of last year’s Prompto Happiness Simulator, this time the focus is on Ignis! **

** I really wanted to make a Happiness Simulator for Ignis from Final Fantasy, because let’s be honest – none of the characters get nearly enough hugs in the game, and I want them to be at least a little bit happy. **

** So I coded up a thing. It’s for free, nonprofit and a tribute work, just a little bit of fun for anyone who, like me, enjoyed the game and wants to put a smile on this boy’s face. **

Since this is fanwork, I cannot stress enough that it's non-commercial and intended as a tribute work, because I love this game to bits.

The storyline of this game is not to be regarded as canon, and it's not an attempt to represent the original creators, it's merely the result of a fan wanting to play in the rich worlds created by such talented people.

Content I created includes game assets - code (made using Ren'py, open source and available on Github), artwork, scripts and music.
